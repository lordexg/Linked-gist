<h1>Linked List Project in C</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This project implements a simple singly linked list in C, allowing you to perform various operations like inserting nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific position, and deleting nodes from the list. The project is an excellent exercise for understanding basic data structures and memory management in C.

<h3>Features</h3>
<strong>- Insert at Beginning</strong>: Add a new node at the start of the linked list.<br/>
<strong>- Insert at End</strong>: Add a new node at the end of the linked list.<br/>
<strong>- Insert at a Specific Position</strong>: Add a new node at any valid position in the linked list.<br/>
<strong>- Delete a Node</strong>: Remove a node from a specific position in the linked list.<br/>
<strong>- Print the Linked List</strong>: Display the current state of the linked list.<br/>
<strong>- Animation</strong>: coming soon.

<h3>Note</h3>
- This project for educational purposes only.<br>
- This reop was named <code>Linked gist</code> deliberately.<br>
